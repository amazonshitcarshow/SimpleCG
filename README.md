# SimpleCG
Simplified CRUD Generator

## Generating a config file

To run SimpleCG, you will have to generate a config.json file. This can be done by using config_generator.php. Simply launch it in any command line interface (**not web-browser**) with the following command and follow the instructions!

`php config_generator.php`

## Generating your CRUD

Finally, generating your CRUD Web-App is as simple as running `php simplecg.php` in your console. The Generator will then do it's magic and will generate an output folder which will contain your CRUD System. When the generator is done, simply copy and paste the output folder to your web-server's content folder.
